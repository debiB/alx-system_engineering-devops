# ALX Shell Scripting Repository

Welcome to the ALX Shell Scripting Repository! This repository is a collection of shell scripts and tasks I've completed as a participant of the ALX program, with a focus on topics like shell redirection, permissions, and variable expansion. Here, you'll find code, documentation, and examples that demonstrate my proficiency in these essential shell scripting concepts.


## Shell Scripting Concepts

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive introduction to critical shell scripting concepts, including:

- **Shell Redirection:** Learning how to manipulate input and output streams, including redirecting input and output, appending to files, and more.

- **Permissions:** Gaining an understanding of Linux file permissions, including chmod and chown commands.

- **Variable Expansion:** Exploring how to use variables within shell scripts, including parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

## Tasks Completed

As a participant of the ALX program, I've worked on various shell scripting tasks that highlight my ability to apply these essential concepts. These tasks include:

- **Shell Redirection Tasks:** Demonstrating the use of redirection operators to handle input and output.

- **Permissions Exercises:** Implementing tasks involving file permissions, ownership, and access control.

- **Variable Expansion Challenges:** Solving problems that require the effective use of variables and expansion techniques.

Each task is organized into its respective directories, containing the shell scripts.
